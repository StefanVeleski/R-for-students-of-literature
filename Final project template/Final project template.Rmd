## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including images not generated by code

Just make sure that the image is in the right place relative to your `.Rmd` file. This means that you can have a subfolder within your main project folder dedicated to images, but the path would then be `./images/KAA.png`.

## Including in-text citations

This template will use the standard pandoc Chicago author-date format for citations and references, so there is no need to include .csl metadata files.

Here is an example of how a text with in-text citations will actually look like. 

Power law distributions can occur as a consequence of random drift @Bentley2004 [p.1443].

This can be seen across a wide range of cultural traits @MichaelTauberg2018.
